# Experienced Professional

I'm an experienced software engineer with over six years of experience and a reputation for building high-quality, scalable systems.

I've worked as a software developer for companies like Amazon and Facebook. I'm skilled in building complex and robust applications that can handle large amounts of traffic from multiple web servers and database servers. I love working on challenging and rewarding projects, but also measurable by the number of users or views the application has.

Reach out to me for any business opportunities on LinkedIn.
